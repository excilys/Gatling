Understanding Feeders
=====================

Why use feeders?
----------------

If you want to simulate 100 users, each with its own credentials for example, you need to inject data in the simulation for each user. Another similar use case could be requests consuming data to simulate the creation of records in the database via the tested application (new products, carts, etc.)

What feeders are exactly
------------------------

A Feeder is an object **shared amongst users** that will inject data into a given user's Session every time it reaches a feed method call.

Technically speaking, it's an Iterator[Map[String, T]], meaning that the component created by the feed method will poll Map[String, T] records and inject its content. 

Depending on where you place the ``feed`` method, the data injected in the session won't be the same. Imagine the following scenario extract::

	val userCredentials = csv("user_credentials.csv").queue
	val recordsInformation = csv("records_information.csv").queue

	val scn = scenario("My Scenario")
	  .feed(userCredentials)
	  .repeat(20) {
	      feed(recordsInformation)
	      .exec( ...)
	  }
	  // End of Scenario
	  
	setUp(scn.users(100))

At the ``End of Scenario`` line, the data contained in the session for one user is half predictible:

* The data from the ``userCredentials`` feeder will match the userId of the session (the first launched scenario will get the first value from the file and so on)
* The data from the ``recordsInformation`` feeder could be anything. Indeed, each user will get values from the feeder simultaneously (because of the loop). Therefore, one cannot predict what records will be created by which user.

.. note:: If the first ``feed`` method was called after the loop, there would be no guarantees that the 20th user would have taken the 20th line of the feeder.

Data Sources
============

Data Sources are basically Array[Map[String, T]].

Map keys are the names of the attributes once a record has been pushed in a user's Session.

File Parsers
------------

Gatling provide support for separated values files. There are three types of separated values files supported:

* Comma Separated Values (CSV).
* Semicolon Separated Values (SSV).
* Tabulation Separated Values (TSV).

To parse a file with a separated values file as source, use the following methods::

	csv( filename: String ) // If the values are _comma_ separated
	ssv( filename: String ) // If the values are _semi colon_ separated
	tsv( filename: String ) // If the values are _tabulation_ separated

.. note:: The separated values file must be in the ``user-files/data`` folder.

The first line of the file must contain the label of the values::

	username,password
	john,smith21
	john,doe43

These labels will be used as keys to the values stored in the session, for example ``${username}``.

Using Escaping Character *(since 1.1.0)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you choose to create a CSV file but some values contain the ``,`` character, you can escape them with the ``\`` character.

If you want to use another escaping character, you can set one while declaring your feeder::

	val userCredentials = csv("user_credentials.csv", '#')

JDBC *(since 1.1.0)*
--------------------

Gatling provide support for JDBC data. You can get values from a database instead of a file. The method signatures are all the same for every supported database::

	jdbcFeeder( databaseURL: String, username: String, password: String, sql: String)

The ``databaseURL`` must be a JDBC URL (ie: ``jdbc:postgresql:gatling``), the ``username`` and ``password`` are the credentials to access the database and ``sql`` is the request that will get the values needed.

Only JDBC4 drivers are supported, so that they automatically registers to the DriverManager.
 
.. note:: Do not forget to add the required JDBC driver jar in the classpath (``lib/`` folder in the bundle)

.. _redis:

Redis *(since 1.2.2)*
---------------------

Redis can be used as a Data Source. The dynamic data can be loaded on a Redis List, popped out for each http request and the value placed in a session variable.
Since v2.1.14 Redis supports mass insertion of data from a `file <http://redis.io/topics/mass-insert>`_. It is possible to load millions of keys in a few seconds in Redis and Gatling will read them off memory directly.

For i.e : A simple Scala function to generate a file with 1 million different urls ready to be loaded in a Redis list named URLS ::

	import com.excilys.ebi.gatling.core.feeder.redis.util._

	def generateOneMillionUrls() = {
	  val fileLocation = "/tmp/loadtest.txt"
	  val writer = new PrintWriter(new File(fileLocation))
	  try {
	    for (i <- 0 to 1000000) {
	      val url = "test?id=" + i.toString()
	      writer.write(generateRedisProtocol("LPUSH", "URLS", url))
	    }
	  } finally {
	    writer.close()
	  }
	}

The urls can then be loaded in Redis using the following command ::

	cat /tmp/loadtest.txt | redis-cli --pipe

An example simulation to use this redis feeder can be viewed `here <https://gist.github.com/2888230>`_.

.. note:: At the moment only queue feeder strategy is supported for Redis.

Built-ins: getting a Feeder from a Data Source
==============================================

Gatling provides some syntactic sugars for converting Data Source into Feeders.

Queue strategy *(since 1.0)*
----------------------------

The default strategy (ie: if you don't specify one) is the queue strategy. Each time ``feed`` is called, the first record of the feeder is removed from the queue and injected into the session.

Be careful while using this strategy, the feeder source must contain enough records for the simulation; if not, the simulation will stop when the queue is empty.

Example::

	csv("user_credentials.csv").queue
	csv("user_credentials.csv")        // It is the same as above since queue is the default strategy

Random strategy *(since 1.0)*
-----------------------------

For this strategy, each time ``feed`` is called, a random record is picked inside the feeder and injected into the session.

The records are not removed from the feeder when injected.

Example::

	csv("user_credentials.csv").random

Circular strategy *(since 1.1)*
-------------------------------

The circular strategy will loop on the values contained in the feeder. If there are N values in the feeder and the ``feed`` method has been called N+1 times, then, the record #1 will be injected.

Example::

	csv("user_credentials.csv").circular

Concurrent Queue strategy *(since 1.3)*
---------------------------------------

The above built-ins are not thread-safe, mainly because you usually don't need sync as long as:

* you only pop from a given feeder at one and only one place in your scenario
* or, you don't really care about sync in your use case (ex: do you really really need sync on a random feeder?)

This works well thanks to `how Akka works with the Java Memory Model <http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/general/jmm.html>`_.

For those who don't fall in one of the above cases, please use this strategy.

Example:: 

	csv("user_credentials.csv").concurrentQueue

Custom Feeders
==============

Feeder is a simple abstract class with one signe method called ``next`` that return a Map[String, T] of key/values.

The example below reuses the Gatling built-ins from a static Data Source.

::

	val feeder = Array(Map("foo" -> "bar", "baz" -> "qux").circular

The example below builds a feeder that generated random user data.

::

	val myCustomFeeder = new Feeder[String] {
	  import org.joda.time.DateTime
	  import scala.util.Random

	  private val RNG = new Random

	  // random number in between [a...b]
	  private def randInt(a:Int, b:Int) = RNG.nextInt(b-a) + a

	  private def daysOfMonth(year:Int, month:Int) = new DateTime(year, month, 1, 0, 0, 0, 000).dayOfMonth.getMaximumValue

	  // always return true as this feeder can be polled infinitively
	  override def hasNext = true

	  override def next: Map[String, String] = {
	    val email = scala.math.abs(java.util.UUID.randomUUID.getMostSignificantBits) + "_gatling@dontsend.com"
	    val year = randInt(1945, 1994)
	    val month = randInt(1, 12)
	    val day = randInt(1, daysOfMonth(year, month))

	    Map("contactEmail" -> email, 
	        "birthdayYear" -> year.toString, 
	        "birthdayMonth" -> month.toString, 
	        "birthdayDay" -> day.toString)
	    }
	}
