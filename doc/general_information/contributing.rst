Filing issues
=============

You can file issues on the issue tracker (located here on Github) to:

* **Say that you've found a bug**. Before filing an issue :

  * Make sure it's indeed an issue and not a misusage. If you're not sure, feel free to ask on the `Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gatling>`_.
  * Please check if a similar one doesn't already exist. 

* **Say that there is a missing feature**. We try to think about many things, but smart ideas are always welcomed and we are eager for user experience.
* **Say that you've found spelling errors in the wiki**. We tried to be perfect, but it is incredibly hard... ;-)
