As Gatling runs and executes requests, several timings are recorded, which make up the basis of all forms of reporting in Gatling: console, HTML reports, etc...

## Active Users

At a given second, active users are computed as:

```
  (the number of active users at the previous second)
+ (the number of users who started during this second)
- (the number of users who finished during the previous second)
```

## Requests

### Response Time

The response time is the elapsed time between:

* the instant Gatling tries to send a request. It accounts for:
  * DNS resolution time (might be bypassed if it's already cached). Note that the DNS resolution time metric is available in Gatling Enterprise.
  * TCP connect time (might be bypassed if a keep-alive connection is available in the connection pool). Note that the TCP connect time metric is available in Gatling Enterprise.
  * TLS handshake time (might be bypassed if a keep-alive connection is available in the connection pool). Note that the TLS handshake time metric is available in Gatling Enterprise.
  * HTTP round trip
* the instant Gatling receives a complete response or experiences an error (timeout, connection error, etc)

## Groups

### Count

The counts are the number of group executions, not the sum of the counts of each individual request in that group.

### Response Time

The response time of a group is the cumulated response times of each individual request in that group.

When dealing with embedded resources (inferred or explicitly set), the behaviour is slightly different: as resources are fetched asynchronously,
the cumulated response time for embedded resources starts from the beginning of the first resource request to the end of the last resource request.

### Duration

Group duration is the elapsed time between the instant a virtual user enters a group and the instant it exits.

Group duration is reported in the "Duration" charts.

### Cumulated Response Time

Group cumulated response time is the time in a group when requests are flying: requests' response time and resources start to end duration.
In short, it's the group duration minus the pauses.

Group cumulated response time is reported in the "Cumulated Response Time" charts.
