[Gatling FrontLine](https://gatling.io/gatling-frontline/) has a dedicated Bamboo plugin.
This plugin can launch a FrontLine simulation and display live metrics.
Please refer to Gatling FrontLine documentation for the installation of this plugin.

There is no Bamboo plugin for Gatling OSS, but you can launch a Gatling run with our [Maven](||< ref "docs/maven_plugin" >||) or [SBT](||< ref "docs/sbt_plugin" >||) plugin.
