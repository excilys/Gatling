[Gatling Enterprise](https://gatling.io/enterprise/) has a dedicated Bamboo plugin.
This plugin can launch a Gatling Enterprise simulation and display live metrics.
Please refer to Gatling Enterprise documentation for the installation of this plugin.

There is no Bamboo plugin for Gatling OSS, but you can launch a Gatling run with our [Maven]({{< ref "maven_plugin" >}}), [Gradle]({{< ref "gradle_plugin" >}}) or [SBT]({{< ref "sbt_plugin" >}}) plugin.
