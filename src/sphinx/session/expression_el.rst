Expression Language
===================

Most Gatling DSL methods can be passed *Expression Language* Strings.

This is a very convenient feature to write dynamic values.

Gatling automagically parses those Strings and turn them into functions that will compute a result based on the data stored into the Session.

Yet it's very limited, don't expect a full blown dynamic language!

Gatling EL uses a ``${attributeName}`` syntax, where *attributeName* is the name of an attribute in the Session.

For example::

  request("page").get("/foo?${bar}")

Moreover, Gatling EL provide the following built-in functions::

  "${foo.size()}"   // returns the size of `foo` if `foo` is a Scala or Java collection
  "${foo.random()}" // returns a random element of `foo` if `foo` is an indexable collection
  "${foo(5)}"       // returns the 5th element of `foo` if `foo` is an indexable collection
  "${foo(n)}"       // returns the n-th element of `foo` if `n` is an Int and `foo` is an indexable collection
  "${foo.bar}"      // returns the value associated with key `bar` if `foo` is a map
  "${foo._2}"       // returns second element of Tuple or Pair object

You can also combine different Gatling EL builtin functions. For example if ``foo`` is a List of Lists ``${foo(0)(0)}`` will return first element of the first list in ``foo``. ``${foo.list.random()}`` will return random element from an indexable collection associated with key ``list`` in a map ``foo``.
 
Gatling EL supports the following indexable collections: java.util.List, Seq and Array. It also supports both Scala and Java maps. Function ``.size`` supports any Scala or Java collection.

.. warning::
  This Expression Language only works on the final value that is passed to the DSL method when the Simulation is instantiated.

  For example, ``queryParam("latitude", "${latitude}".toInt + 24)`` won't work,
  the program will blow on ``"${latitude}".toInt`` as this String can't be parsed into an Int.

  The solution here would be to pass a function:

  ``session => session("latitude").validate[Int].map(i => i + 24)``.

.. _expression:

Expression
==========

Most Gatling DSL methods actually takes ``Expression[T]`` parameters, which is a type alias for ``Session => Validation[T]``.

How is it that one can also pass Strings and other values then?

The reason is that there are implicit conversions:

* when passing a String, it gets automagically parsed turn them into Expressions thanks to Gatling EL compiler.
* when passing a value of another type, it gets automagically wrapped into an Expression that will always return this static value.

.. warning::
  Implicit conversions are only triggered when expected type and passed parameter type don't match, for example trying to pass a String to a method that expects an Expression instead.
  Those implicit conversions are triggered at compile time.
